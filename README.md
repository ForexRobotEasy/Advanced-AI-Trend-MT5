## Product Description

The Advanced AI Trend MT5 is a sophisticated Forex robot that utilizes advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to identify entry and exit points in the market. It is designed to trade on the MetaTrader 5 platform and is suitable for both beginner and experienced traders.

### Features

- Automatic Trading: The robot can automatically enter and exit trades based on its AI-based entry point identification system.
- Risk Management: The lot size for each trade is calculated based on the account balance and risk management rules.
- Take Profit and Stop Loss: The robot sets take profit and stop loss levels for each trade to manage risk and maximize profits.
- Long-Term Growth Focus: The robot is designed with a focus on long-term growth, ensuring a sustainable trading strategy.
- Calm Period Entry: The robot also implements a safe entry point identification system during calm market periods.

### How It Works

The Advanced AI Trend MT5 robot operates as follows:

1. Initialization: The robot initializes its tasks and settings in the OnInit() function.
2. Tick Function: The OnTick() function is called on each tick of the market. It checks if there is an open trade and takes appropriate action based on the trade's performance.
3. Trade Management: If there is an open trade, the robot checks if the trade has reached the take profit or stop loss levels. If so, the trade is closed. Otherwise, it continues to monitor the trade.
4. Entry Conditions: If there is no open trade, the robot checks for entry conditions. It implements AI-based entry point identification and safe entry point identification during calm market periods.
5. Opening a Trade: If the entry conditions are met, the robot calculates the lot size based on the account balance and risk management rules. If the calculated lot size is greater than the minimum allowed, a buy trade is opened at the current Ask price.
6. Closing a Trade: The CloseTrade() function is called to close an open trade. It closes the trade at the current Bid price.
7. Can Open Trade: The CanOpenTrade() function is called to check if a new trade can be opened. This function can be customized to implement specific conditions for opening trades.
